      <p>
        In 2022, I founded <a
          href="https://marketbuddy.com.au"
          target="_blank"
          class="text-indigo-600 underline">MarketBuddy</a
        >, Australia's commercial property analytics platform that provides
        real-time market data on 100,000+ properties - solving a problem I
        personally encountered as a practicing commercial real estate agent.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey spans both technical and business domains. I hold a Bachelor
        of Engineering/Computer Science from the University of Melbourne and am
        a fully licensed Victorian estate agent. I lead the Commercial Division
        and IT Department at <a
          href="https://jarrel.com.au"
          target="_blank"
          class="text-indigo-600 underline">Jarrel Estate Agents</a
        >, my family's real estate business with roots dating back to 1929.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond MarketBuddy, I founded <a
          href="https://latentstack.ai"
          target="_blank"
          class="text-indigo-600 underline">Latent Stack</a
        >, an AI consultancy that helps businesses move from AI awareness to AI
        implementation - building the automations, copilots, and systems that
        reshape how teams operate.
      </p>
      <p>
        My family's story adds depth to my professional mission. After
        emigrating from Belarus in 1991, my mother Tanya Jarrel Ph.D. built one
        of Melbourne's respected real estate practices. I continue this legacy
        by combining my parents' expertise in technology and property.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe the best innovations emerge from deeply understanding industry
        challenges - and I'm building the tools I wished existed when I started.
